# DungeonBossSimulator
Orbital 2023:

Proposed Level of Achievement:
Apollo

Game Ideation:
Rogue-like games have captivated players with their challenging gameplay, procedurally generated levels, and permadeath mechanics.
We were inspired by the success and appeal of these games and wanted to create our own unique twist on the genre, where players play as the dungeon boss instead of the adventurer. Our game, "Dungeon Boss Simulator," incorporates key features inspired by rogue-like game mechanics.
Players will face off against different enemy types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, offering diverse and strategic gameplay.
We'll implement a progression system where players can acquire different ability upgrades or even upgrade their dungeon, enhancing their boss character and adding depth to the gameplay experience.

Character Designs and Art Style:
We made use of the wide array of assests available on the internet. Free assests from the unity assest store as well as from websites like itch.io have provided us with the necessary art designs for our project.

Tech Stack:
- Unity
- C#
After careful consideration, we chose Unity as our game engine for several reasons.
Unity provides an extensive collection of 2D assets on the Unity Asset Store, allowing us to easily create a visually appealing retro-style game.
The engine's active community support ensures we have access to helpful resources and a community to seek guidance from.
Additionally, Unity offers comprehensive documentation, making it an excellent choice for developers, whether they are experienced or just starting their game development journey.

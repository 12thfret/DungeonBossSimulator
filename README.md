# DungeonBossSimulator
Orbital 2023:

Our game, "Dungeon Boss Simulator," incorporates key features inspired by rogue-like game mechanics.
Players will face off against different enemy types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, offering diverse and strategic gameplay.
We'll implement a progression system where players can acquire different ability upgrades or even upgrade their dungeon, enhancing their boss character and adding depth to the gameplay experience.
